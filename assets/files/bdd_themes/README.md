## Installation
In order to use these themes, it is required to have [Bandaged Better Discord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases "Bandaged Better Discord") installed.

After BDD is successfully installed, open Discord and navigate to **User Settings > Themes > Open Theme Folder**. Once the folder is opened, download the `.css` files from this repository and place them inside the themes folder. Once that is done, go back to Discord and press **CTRL + R** to restart your client.

The themes should appear in the list now. Enable the one you'd like.

Make sure you're using Discord's Dark Theme!

Enjoy! :)
